This repository will some day contain solutions to all of the [Matasano crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/). This is still an incomplete work in progress.

This project requires Python 3 and PyCrypto. PyCrypto can be installed by running `pip3 install pycrypto` from the command line.

In case anyone is reading this: feel free to fork or copy my code, but please don't try to help me in any way unless I explicitly ask for help. I am doing this for the learning experience, and I want to figure this out by myself.
