This repo will some day contain a program that solves all the Matasano crypto challenges. This is still a very incomplete work in progress.

This project requires Python 3 and PyCrypto.

In case anyone is reading this: please don't try to help me in any way unless I explicitly ask for help. I am doing this for the learning experience, and I want to figure this out by myself.
