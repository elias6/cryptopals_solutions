This repository will some day contain solutions to all of the [Cryptopals crypto challenges](http://cryptopals.com/) (formerly the Matasano crypto challenges). This is still an incomplete work in progress.

This project requires Python 3 and PyCryptodome. PyCryptodome can be installed by running `pip3 install pycryptodomex` from the command line.

After checking out this repository, the program can be run from the command line by running `./challenges.py`. For information about more options, including running individual challenges, run `./challenges.py --help`.

In case anyone is reading this: feel free to fork or copy my code, but please don't try to help me in any way unless I explicitly ask for help. I am doing this for the learning experience, and I want to figure this out by myself.
